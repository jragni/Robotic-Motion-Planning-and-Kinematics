# Robotic Motion Planning and Kinematics

A repository that contains my solutions to problems from "Lectures on Robotic Planning and Kinematics"
by Francesco Bullo and Stephen L. Smith. 
This repository is to track my progress in learning Motion Planning and kinematics
algorithms in MATLAB code. Once completed, versions using C++ and Python will
be added and then applied to ROS.com
